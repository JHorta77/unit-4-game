# How the app works 

When the game starts, the player will choose a character by clicking on a characters picture. The player will fight as that character for the rest of the game. The players goal is to defeat the remaining characters. Enemies will be moved to a different area of the screen. The player chooses an opponent by clicking on an enemy's picture. Once the player selects an opponent, that enemy is moved to a defender area. 

The player will then click on the attack button. That will make the enemies life points go down aswhile as your own. The enemy too can attack you and is why you will lose life points. Once you defeat the enemy charater choice another character to fight.
